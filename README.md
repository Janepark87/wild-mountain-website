Wild Mountain Hotel Booking Website is a **Next.js web application** designed to provide guests with an intuitive platform to explore the hotel, browse available cabins, and manage their reservations. This project extends the **Wild Mountain Hotel Management App** by offering a seamless **customer-facing** experience while integrating with the same **Supabase database and API**.

## What I Learned from This Project
Working on this project helped me expand my front-end development skills while gaining hands-on experience with full-stack concepts. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Building a Full-Stack Application**  
  - This project reinforced my understanding of how a front-end application interacts with a backend database, particularly by sharing data between two separate applications.  

- **Authentication & User Management**  
  - Implementing sign-up, login, and user profile management with Supabase deepened my knowledge of handling authentication and securing user data.  

- **Dynamic Data & API Integration**  
  - I learned how to efficiently manage dynamic data, ensuring that reservations update in real-time and synchronize correctly with the internal hotel management app.  

- **Optimizing UI/UX for Guest Interaction**  
  - Designing an intuitive experience for users, from filtering cabins to viewing past bookings, improved my approach to UI/UX considerations in real-world applications.  

## Acknowledgments
This project was built while following "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. The course provided valuable guidance on advanced React patterns, database integration, and full-stack development workflows, which I applied while building and structuring this project.
